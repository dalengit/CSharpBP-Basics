Application Architecture 

The application tracks the products Acme buys from approved vendors. 
- In the solution there are projects - "Acme.Biz" etc, a project defines a component of the app 
- Each project is compiled into an executable, otherwise known as DLL. 
- First step in creating a C# app is defining the components and then creating a project for each component - easy to maintain/navigate codebase. 

UI Layer 
- Windows forms - Acme.Win
- WPF - Acme.Wpf
- Web Sales - Acme.Web 

Business Logic Layer
- Acme.Biz - here we put the business logic for our application 
- We should put business logic into it's own component so it can be extendable: open/closed principle/SRP

Data Access Layer 
- Acme.Data 
- The data access component provides all communication with DB 
- Also implemented through class libraries and Entity Framework (EF)

Common Layer 
- Acme.Common - common components for our code 
- Implemented through class libraries
